# Create Your First Workflow

We have created two tutorials that you can follow to get familiar with the process of building workflows in n8n. Feel free to choose one that resonates the most with you and the tasks that you plan to automate.

- Option A: [Daily Weather Notifications with OpenWeatherMap and Twilio ☀️](./daily-weather-notifications/README.md)
- Option B: [Automate Product Feedback with Typeform, Airtable, and Trello 📈](./get-product-feedback/README.md)
