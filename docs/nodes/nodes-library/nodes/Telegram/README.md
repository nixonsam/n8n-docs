## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send a cocktail recipe to a specified chat ID every day via a Telegram bot. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/781) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Cron](../../core-nodes/Cron/README.md)
- [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/HTTPRequest/README.md)
- [Telegram]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

## FAQs

### How can I send more than 30 messages per second?

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow the steps mentioned below to send more than 30 messages:
1. Split In Batches node: Use the [Split in Batches](../../core-nodes/SplitInBatches/README.md) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
2. Telegram node: Connect the Telegram node with the Split In Batches node. Use the ***Expression Editor*** to select the Chat IDs from the Split in Batches node.
3. Function node: Connect the [Function](../../core-nodes/Function/README.md) node with the Telegram node. Use the Function node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Split In Batches node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).

### How do I add a bot to a Telegram channel?

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and tap on the channel name.
2. Make sure that the channel name is labeled as "public channel".
3. Tap on ***Administrators*** and then on ***Add Admin***.
4. Search for the username of the bot and select it.
5. Tap on the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

### How do I get the Chat ID?

There are two ways to get the Chat ID in Telegram.

- Using the [Telegram Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/TelegramTrigger/README.md) node: On successful execution, the Telegram Trigger node returns a Chat ID. You can use the Telegram Trigger node in your workflow to get a Chat ID.
- Using the `@RawDataBot`: The `@RawDataBot` returns the raw data of the chat with a Chat ID. Invite the `@RawDataBot` to your channel/group, and upon joining, it will output a Chat ID along with other information. Be sure to remove the `@RawDataBot` from your group/channel afterwards.
