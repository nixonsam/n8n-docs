## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a new issue in Jira. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/459) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Jira]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

## FAQs

### How to fetch issues for a specific project?

The 'Get All' operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use JQL (Jira Query Language).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below.
- Select 'Get All' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
- Toggle ***Return All*** to true.
- Click on ***Add Option*** and select 'JQL'.
- Enter `project=n8n` in the ***JQL*** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.

You can refer to the [official documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql) about JQL to learn more about it.
