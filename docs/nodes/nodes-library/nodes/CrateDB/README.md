# CrateDB

[CrateDB](https://crate.io/) is an open-source distributed SQL database management system that integrates a fully searchable document-oriented data store based on a shared-nothing architecture, and is designed for high scalability.

## Basic Operations

- Execute an SQL query
- Insert rows in database
- Update rows in database


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a table and insert data into it in CrateDB. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/597) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Set](../../core-nodes/Set/README.md)
- [CrateDB]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. CrateDB node (Execute Query)

## FAQs

### How to specify the data type of a column?
To specify the data type of a column, append the column name with `:type`, where `type` is the data type of that column. For example, if you want to specify the type `int` for the column *id* and type `text` for the column *name*, you can use the following snippet in the ***Columns*** field: `id:init,name:text`.
