# Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

::: tip ðŸ”‘ Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/Redis/README.md).

## Basic Operations

- Delete a key
- Return the value of a key
- Return generic information about the Redis instance
- Return all the keys matching a pattern
- Set the value of a key in Redis


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get the value of a key in Redis. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/557) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Redis]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Redis node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Redis node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/Redis/README.md).
2. Select the 'Get' option from the *Operation* dropdown list.
3. Enter the key for which you want to retrieve the value in the *Key* field.
