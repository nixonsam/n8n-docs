# Activation Trigger

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind
If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
:::

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. The Activation Trigger node can be used to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node Reference

- Events
    - ***Activation:*** Run when the workflow gets activated
    - ***Start:*** Run when n8n starts or restarts
    - ***Update:*** Run when the workflow gets saved while it is active

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to receive a message on Mattermost when a workflow is updated. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1033) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Activation Trigger]()
- [Mattermost](../../nodes/Mattermost/README.md)

The final workflow should look like the following image.

The Activation Trigger node will trigger the workflow when the workflow gets updated.
